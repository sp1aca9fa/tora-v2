# GitHub CI's verdict on one commit of this repo, as one word (docs/home-server.md section 7):
#
#   ops/ci-status.sh <full 40-character commit sha>
#
#   success   the CI job's run (named exactly `check`) concluded success, and every counted run
#             completed and concluded success, neutral or skipped
#   failure   a completed counted run concluded anything else (failure, cancelled, timed out, ...)
#   pending   a counted run is not completed yet, or no `check` run concluded success: none yet, CI
#             renamed or removed, or `check` skipped or neutral, which means CI did not test the
#             commit (the 24-hour alert says so)
#   unknown   no answer to trust: the remote is not github.com, the sha is not a full sha, curl
#             failed, GitHub answered an error (a rate limit too) or something unreadable
#
# Counted: every check run except the process job, dropped by its exact name in the code below. It
# reports on how the work was done and never holds back an update, whatever its result, and it can
# never stand in for CI (docs/ci.md, "Process check"). The name stays on one line of this file: the
# server check before that job lands counts the lines holding it.
#
# The update script (ops/update-server.sh --auto) installs a commit only on `success`; anything
# else never counts as green. Check runs (GitHub Actions) are the signal; the older commit status
# API is not read. No token: the repo is public (60 calls an hour per address unauthenticated).
# It never prints GitHub's answer, only the word; it always exits 0.
